# Air Pollution Data Analysis Project

Project developed as part of the Exploratory Data Analysis Course offered by the Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

Each script generates a plot intended to answer a question about PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) emissions in the United States, using the datasets provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). More information about the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) can be found at the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site](https://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html).

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data used in this analysis are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

The questions and tasks addressed by each script are:

`plot1.R`

* Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?

`plot2.R`

* Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008?

`plot3.R`

* Of the four types of sources indicated by the *type* (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?

`plot4.R`

* Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

`plot5.R`

* How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

`plot6.R`

* Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
